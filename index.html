                        <p>During the fall 2024 semester, I worked with a group of three other researchers to determine what impacts extreme Arctic Oscillation would have on
                       the northern Atlantic Ocean. Over the course of the semester, we developed our research question, tested numerous climate models, and presented
                       our findings at the annual FIRE Summit at the University of Maryland. Our research was conducted as a part of the First-Year Innovation and Research 
                       Experience at the University of Maryland, specifically within the Climate Computing stream of the program fascilitated by Dr. Sara Strey.</p>

                    who are beginning their own research projects and need help with the fundamentals of research and intricacies of running climate models.</p>

                <h3>Programming Counselor</h3>
                <p> This past summer I worked as a programming counselor at TIC camp, where I taught campers ages 7 to 15 how to program video games in Scratch, Processing (Java), and Lua in a fun and engaging manner. 
                    My main task was guiding campers in their programming of various 2D games, including multiple types of platformers, dungeon crawlers, 
                    and fighting games, as well as 3D games including first-person shooters and top-down player versus environment games with custom art.
                    At the end of each two week session, I assisted the campers in presentin their video games to their parents and uploaded them to a website</p>

                <h3>Software Intern</h3>
                <p>While working as a software intern at Perlman Camp, my primary task was developing a project that contained an algortihm for sorting campering into activities. 
                    For this project I learned how to use the Apache Maven build automation tool, utilizing the Apache POI commands to read and write to Excel sheets.
                    To handle sorting the hundreds of campers into their activities, I developed my own dynamic sorting algorithm for the project. Once deployed, I conducted maintenance 
                    and testing on the project throughout the summer when the program was in use, calibrating the sorting algorithm to the campâ€™s requests.</p>
